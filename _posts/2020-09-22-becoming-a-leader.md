description: My transition from a Developer to a Project Lead

In this post I'll share my experience and feelings of transitioning from a Developer to a Team Lead so far (still in progress).

It all started from [Dev(){CoP}](https://devcop.io/), a meet up where developer community comes together, share ideas, give suggestions based on topics and discussions written on sticky notes for which it uses an open source web-simulator called [Scrumblr](http://scrumblr.ca/).

One of the organisers of the meetup had an idea of finding a way to get topics (written on sticky notes), from the past. This feature didn't seem to be implemented in the simulator. It sounded exciting and a fun challenge to me. Hence, I volunteered to implement. Seeing me, another developer volunteered too. Then, invited one more developer and he accepted the invitation too.

As I love working with others, I have formed team of three developers (including me) so far. 

### Tools

Below are the tools I am using:

#### Jira

To keep track of all the activities happening within the project. 

Setting up Jira was a slight challenge as I wasn't aware that certain projects could not be hidden from certain users in free version (I was already using Jira for one personal project). When I found out, it can't be done, I purchased the paid version. Life got a whole lot easier now!

#### Google Calendar

To organise meetings.

Having meeting with an agenda, a definite purpose and ensuring everyone stays on the topic, productive and has fun at the same time. After the meeting finishes, I record meeting minutes in Jira with action items to follow.

### Feeling
I am becoming even more confident, productive and consistent, talking concisely and to the point. That being said, there is however a feeling of constant pressure on me that I need to lead by example and have expectation from myself which will result in setting high standards for my team too. It is uncomfortable but nothing great is achieved from staying in the comfortable zone. So loving it.

### Experience

**Thinking Differently -** I am not just thinking technically, instead finding more about my team members' personality types, getting to know them, their strengths and weeknesses and how to untilize them to achieve the best outcome possible.

**Solution Oriented Mindset -** I have always loved to solve problem incorporating technology. Having a solution mindset is being extremely favourable to me in this transition.
